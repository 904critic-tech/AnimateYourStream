# 🚨 BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK

**Template Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Prevent cross-team conflicts and maintain clear file ownership  
**Last Updated**: [TIMESTAMP]  

---

## 📋 **BOUNDARY ENFORCEMENT OVERVIEW**

This framework ensures that AI agents work within their assigned boundaries and do not interfere with other teams' work. Clear boundaries prevent conflicts, reduce coordination overhead, and maintain project stability.

### **🎯 Key Principles**
1. **Strict Role Adherence** - Agents work ONLY within assigned scope
2. **Clear File Ownership** - Each file has a designated owner
3. **No Cross-Team Interference** - No unauthorized modifications
4. **Escalation Protocol** - Issues outside scope go to coordinator
5. **Dependency Communication** - Report dependencies without implementing solutions

## 🚨 **BOUNDARY VIOLATION PROTOCOL**

### **📋 Violation Detection**
1. **Immediate Detection**: Identify unauthorized file modifications
2. **Escalation**: Report violation to coordinator immediately
3. **Revert Changes**: Require agent to revert unauthorized modifications
4. **Documentation**: Record violation in coordination files
5. **Prevention**: Clarify boundaries and prevent future violations

### **⚠️ Violation Response Steps**
1. **Stop Work**: Immediately stop any unauthorized work
2. **Report**: Notify coordinator of boundary violation
3. **Revert**: Undo any unauthorized changes
4. **Document**: Record violation details
5. **Clarify**: Get clarification on boundaries if unclear
6. **Resume**: Continue work within proper boundaries

### **📝 Violation Documentation**
```markdown
### **🚨 BOUNDARY VIOLATION REPORT**
**Date**: [TIMESTAMP]  
**Agent**: [AGENT_NAME] - [TEAM_NAME]  
**Violation**: [DESCRIPTION_OF_VIOLATION]  
**Files Modified**: [LIST_OF_UNAUTHORIZED_FILES]  
**Action Taken**: [REVERTED_CHANGES/ESCALATED_TO_COORDINATOR]  
**Prevention**: [MEASURES_TO_PREVENT_FUTURE_VIOLATIONS]  
```

## 📞 **COMMUNICATION PROTOCOLS**

### **🔄 Cross-Team Communication**
- **Dependency Reporting**: Report dependencies without implementing solutions
- **Issue Escalation**: Escalate issues outside scope to coordinator
- **Progress Updates**: Update status without interfering with other teams
- **Coordination Requests**: Request coordination for cross-team issues

### **📋 Communication Rules**
1. **No Direct Modifications**: Do not modify other teams' files
2. **Dependency Communication**: Report dependencies to coordinator
3. **Issue Escalation**: Escalate issues outside your scope
4. **Status Updates**: Update status without cross-team interference
5. **Coordination Requests**: Request coordination for cross-team issues

### **🎯 Escalation Procedures**
1. **Identify Issue**: Determine if issue is within your scope
2. **Document Problem**: Clearly describe the issue
3. **Escalate to Coordinator**: Report issue to coordinator
4. **Wait for Direction**: Do not take action until instructed
5. **Follow Instructions**: Implement coordinator's solution
