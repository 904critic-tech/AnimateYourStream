# üö® AGENT 1 - CRITICAL APP FIX ASSIGNMENT

> **Date**: 2024-12-29T03:35:00Z  
> **Priority**: **URGENT** - Blocking all application functionality

## üö® **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

### **Problem Description**
The application is currently showing a minimal test app instead of the full 3D Model Viewer. Users see only:
- "Minimal Test App"
- "Testing basic React bundling"
- Current time display

**This blocks ALL application features from being accessible.**

### **Root Cause**
- `src/App.tsx` contains a minimal test application instead of the full 3D Model Viewer
- The file shows only basic React components instead of the complete application with:
  - 3D Scene integration
  - ModelViewer component
  - All UI panels and features
  - Error boundaries and diagnostics

### **Impact**
- ‚ùå No 3D model viewing capability
- ‚ùå No AI behavior systems accessible
- ‚ùå No animation controls available
- ‚ùå No lip sync features working
- ‚ùå No diagnostics dashboard accessible
- ‚ùå All core functionality blocked

## üìã **TASK ASSIGNMENT**

### **Agent 1 - AI Behavior Team**
**You are assigned this critical fix because:**
1. You have experience with the core application structure
2. You recently completed TypeScript fixes, so you're familiar with the codebase
3. This is a critical blocker preventing all features from working

### **Required Actions**

#### **1. Immediate Investigation**
- [ ] Examine current `src/App.tsx` file
- [ ] Identify what the full application should contain
- [ ] Check for backup or alternative App files in the project

#### **2. Restore Full Application**
- [ ] Replace minimal test app in `src/App.tsx` with full 3D Model Viewer
- [ ] Integrate the following components:
  - Canvas with React Three Fiber
  - Scene component (`src/core/Scene.tsx`)
  - ModelViewer component (`src/core/ModelViewer.tsx`)
  - All UI panels and features
  - Error boundaries and diagnostics
  - Performance monitoring

#### **3. Verification**
- [ ] Test that the application loads the full 3D viewer
- [ ] Verify all features are accessible
- [ ] Confirm no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Test basic functionality

#### **4. Documentation**
- [ ] Document what was changed
- [ ] Explain why the minimal test app was there
- [ ] Update your work documentation

## üéØ **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

After this fix, users should see:
- ‚úÖ Full 3D Model Viewer interface
- ‚úÖ All UI panels and controls
- ‚úÖ 3D scene with model viewing capabilities
- ‚úÖ AI behavior systems accessible
- ‚úÖ Animation controls working
- ‚úÖ All features functional
