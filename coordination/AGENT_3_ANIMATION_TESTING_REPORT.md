# AGENT 3 — Animation Smoke Testing Report

Date: 2025-08-11 02:45 Z
Agent: Agent 3 (Animation Systems Team)
Target: http://localhost:3001 (read-only)

## Scope
- Verify model loads and animation clips are detected
- Confirm default/idle selection and basic playback events
- Capture any console errors/warnings related to animation layers

## Test Inputs
- Scripts executed:
  - `node scripts/test_mixamo_character_loading.cjs`
  - `node scripts/testModelRendering.cjs`

## Observations (console excerpts)
- Canvas/scene initialized; GPU capability scan logged
- Mixamo-compatible loader progress reached 100%; FBX processed
- “Found 2 animations using Mixamo approach”
- “Model loaded with 2 animations” followed by default animation set to `mixamo.com`
- Multiple “Mixamo animation system API set/cleaned up” cycles observed
- Animation blending logs: “Mixamo blending to animation: mixamo.com”, “Animation changed to: mixamo.com”

## Results
- Animations detected: 2
- Default animation: set (mixamo.com)
- Playback: blend and change events logged
- Errors: none detected related to animation loading/playback

## Warnings/Notes
- Test harness warning: `page.waitForTimeout is not a function` (in both test scripts). Non-blocking for runtime; consider replacing with `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(...))` in tests.
- GPU capability diffs logged (informational), no blocking impact observed.

## Conclusion
- PASS: Animation clips load and basic playback path executes; no “Animation not found in layers” observed.

## Next Actions (no code changes in this session)
- Update test scripts to avoid `page.waitForTimeout` for consistency.
- Optional: add assertion for mixer update tick and playing action weight > 0.

Agent: Agent 3 (Animation Systems Team)
Target: http://localhost:3001 (read-only)

## Scope (resume)
- Verify model and animation runtime paths after server brought up

## Test Inputs
- Scripts executed:
  - `node scripts/test_mixamo_character_loading.cjs`
  - `node scripts/testModelRendering.cjs`

## Observations (console excerpts)
- Vite connection established; app loaded
- Loader progress logs from 0% → 100%; FBX processed successfully
- “Found 2 animations using Mixamo approach”
- “Model loaded with 2 animations”; default set to `mixamo.com`
- Animation events: “Mixamo blending to animation: mixamo.com”, “Animation changed to: mixamo.com”
- Rendering logs confirm model Group with 2 children; animation API set/cleaned during lifecycle

## Results
- Mixamo character loading test: PASS (2 animations detected; default set; events observed)
- Model rendering diagnostic: PARTIAL (runtime OK; test emitted `page.waitForTimeout` error near end)

## Notes
- Non-blocking harness issue: `page.waitForTimeout is not a function` present in both scripts
- Suggest replacing waits with: `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, X))`

## Conclusion
- Animation runtime path healthy on default model; animation clips present and switching works.
- Pending: update test scripts to remove `page.waitForTimeout` usage.

## Tests Executed
- `scripts/test_mixamo_character_loading.cjs` – PASS
  - Observed: MixamoAnimationSystem init/cleanup cycles; 2 animations available; mixer updates; no layer/clip errors.

- `scripts/testModelRendering.cjs` – PARTIAL
  - Observed: Scene rendered, Group with 2 children; no console errors. Harness summary reported `modelLoaded: false` though canvas contained 3D content. Treat as harness assertion gap.

## Notes
- No third‑party requests; offline behavior preserved.
- Continue to rely on default idle clip fallback; no anomalies detected.

## Iframe Autorigger Acceptance
- Harness: `scripts/test_iframe_marker_skeleton.cjs`
- Steps: Load Default FBX → Place Markers (guided) → Auto Weights → Play Idle → Toggle Skeleton → Clear
- Console highlights:
  - `[viewer_iframe] viewer ready`
  - `[viewer_iframe] model loaded with clips: 2`
  - `Placed: Hips → Chest → Head → LeftShoulder`
  - `skeleton generated`, `auto weights bound`, `clip playing: mixamo.com`, `cleared`

## Result
- PASS – { hasPlaced:true, hasSkeleton:true, hasWeights:true, hasIdle:true, hasCleared:true }

## Notes
- One non‑blocking 404 present (triaged to Agent 2). UI actions remain fully offline.

## Full-Guided Marker Sequence Acceptance
- Harness: `scripts/test_iframe_marker_skeleton_full.cjs`
- Steps: Load Default FBX → Place all 13 guided markers → Auto Weights → Play Idle → Clear
- Console highlights:
  - `Placed: Hips, Chest, Head, LeftShoulder, LeftElbow, LeftWrist, RightShoulder, RightElbow, RightWrist, LeftKnee, LeftAnkle, RightKnee, RightAnkle`
  - `Markers complete`, `skeleton generated`, `auto weights bound`, `clip playing: mixamo.com`, `cleared`

## Result
- PASS – { hasPlaced:true, markersComplete:true, hasSkeleton:true, hasWeights:true, hasIdle:true, hasCleared:true }

## Save GLB Roundtrip (Headed)
- Harness: `scripts/test_save_glb_roundtrip.cjs` (headed; CDP download capture)
- Steps: Load default FBX → Save GLB → Reload exported file via Select Model

## Results
- Size: 88,081,192 bytes (>100KB)
- ROUNDTRIP: true
- Parse Errors: none observed

## Artifact
- `coordination/artifacts/rigged.glb`

## Additional Tests
- Re-ran `scripts/test_mixamo_character_loading.cjs` after replacing `page.waitForTimeout` with a Promise-based delay – PASS; 2 animations detected; default set; character switching triggered successfully.
- Executed `scripts/testFBXLoading.cjs` (filesystem and code checks) – PARTIAL; flagged “Memory monitoring not integrated” in `ModelViewer` (harness expectation, not a runtime failure).
 - Executed `scripts/test_character_switching_puppeteer.cjs` – PASS; HTTP 200, 44 candidate elements, 1 click attempted, switch detected.

## Phase 2 – Chrome Animation/Performance Verification
- `scripts/agent5_simple_fps_test.cjs`: PASS – Avg FPS ≈ 241, frame time ≈ 4ms; load ~5658ms
- `scripts/agent5_performance_test.cjs`: PASS – FPS ≈ 241; render calls ≈ 2700; triangles ≈ 14.87M; Quality level: ULTRA; load ~1423ms

## Notes
- Avoided running `scripts/testCharacterLoading.cjs` because it spawns its own HTTP server on port 3002, which we are not changing per testing protocol.
