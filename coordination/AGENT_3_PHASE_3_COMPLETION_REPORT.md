# ðŸŽ­ Agent 3 Phase 3 Completion Report

**Agent**: Agent 3 (Animation Systems Team)
**Phase**: Phase 3 â€” Integration & Testing
**Date**: 2025-08-12
**Status**: âœ… COMPLETE

## Summary
- Animations play on the Default FBX model and across programmatically switched models.
- Smooth transitions verified between multiple clips; mixer active.
- Lip sync system confirmed to be active alongside animations.
- Console noise reduced for readability during tests.

## Key Changes
- `src/core/SandboxModelViewer.tsx`:
  - Safe extension detection for URLs; improved loader error logs.
  - Fallback to Default FBX when load fails or no clips present.
  - Exposed helpers on `window.sandboxModelViewer`: `selectCharacter(id)`, `loadCharacterById(id)`, `getAnimations()`.
  - Selection loads pass only URLs to `loadModel`.
- `src/core/AnimationBlender.tsx`, `src/core/AnimationController.tsx`:
  - Throttled init logs to reduce spam.
- `public/Default_Characters/`:
  - Ensured character assets are served via HTTP.
  - Added external Elmo animation set under `public/Default_Characters/Elmo_Animations/`.

## Tests
- `scripts/agent3_test_default_model_animations.cjs`: PASS (animations detected; mixer active)
- `scripts/agent3_programmatic_switch_check.cjs`: PASS (Default FBX + Spider-Man variants + Elmo)
- `scripts/agent3_transition_smoothness_check.cjs`: PASS (no layer warnings; mixerActive true; lipSyncStarted true)
- `scripts/validatePhase3Performance.cjs`: Completed performance validation (report generated)

## Outcomes
- Clips available: e.g., ["mixamo.com", "Take 001"]
- Transitions: smooth; no "animation not found" warnings.
- Lip Sync: initialized and running with animations.

## Notes
- Use `sandboxModelViewer.getAnimations()` to list current clip names.
- When a model has no native clips, we now prefer retargeted external clips (e.g., `Happy Idle.fbx` for Elmo). Procedural idle is a toggleable fallback; no forced model switch.

## Post-Phase 3 Update (Retargeting)
- Elmo: `Happy Idle` FBX retargeted and auto-plays on load. Additional clips can be added to expand the set (walk/run/gestures).
- Code: `src/core/Retargeting.ts` (name mapping + track remap), hooked in `src/core/SandboxModelViewer.tsx`.

## Next (Optional)
- Deeper lip sync QA under varied animation states (handoff to Agent 4).
