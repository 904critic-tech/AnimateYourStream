## 🚦 COORDINATION STATUS

### ✅ COORDINATION STRENGTHS
- **Single Active Agent**: Only Core Engine Team active, preventing conflicts
- **Clear Dependencies**: Each team has explicit dependency requirements
- **Shared State**: All teams use unified Zustand store
- **Handoff Points**: 12 TODO markers clearly indicate team responsibilities
- **Non-Overlapping Scope**: Each team has distinct responsibilities

### ⚠️ POTENTIAL RISKS (MONITORED)
- **State Conflicts**: Multiple teams could modify overlapping state
- **File Conflicts**: Multiple agents editing same components
- **No Lock Mechanism**: No prevention of simultaneous file access

### 🎯 NEXT COORDINATION ACTIONS
1. **Continue single-agent approach** until Core Engine completes
2. **Monitor TODO handoff points** for team activation triggers
3. **Update this tracker** when team status changes
4. **Activate teams** only when dependencies are fully met
